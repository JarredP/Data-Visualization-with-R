This repository contains the Rmarkdown files for Data visualization projects I completed using R and RStudio.
These projects showcase several data analysis and visualization skills using multiple packages and functions to clean, explore and visualization large and complex data sets.
- Student Mental Health project - Investigation into student mental health and how it can be impacted by a variety of variables.
- US mass shootings project - Analysis of US mass shooting cases 1982-2022 to better understand how certain variables may be linked with mass shooting incidents.

You will also find the csv files used for these projects.
